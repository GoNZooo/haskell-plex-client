# plex-client

## WIP  

This is incomplete and really just a moving target at this point. The idea is to provide a basic
interface with which we can interact with Plex, then possibly build more interesting abstractions on
top of that.

Very likely the coverage of this API will be narrow until there is a use case for broader things and
much of it will be added on-demand.
